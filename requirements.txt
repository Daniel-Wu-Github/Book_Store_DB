# This is a Java-first project. Dependency management is expected to be handled
# by Maven or Gradle. Use the project's build file (pom.xml or build.gradle)
# to declare dependencies. Below are suggested Maven coordinates you can add
# to your `pom.xml` dependencies section as a reference.
This project uses Maven for dependency and build management. See `pom.xml` for the
full list of runtime and test dependencies (Spring Boot starters, MySQL driver,
JWT libs, Lombok, etc.).

Useful commands:

```bash
# build and run tests
mvn clean package

# run the app (development)
mvn spring-boot:run

# run tests only
mvn test
```

If you'd prefer a Gradle build instead of Maven, I can add a `build.gradle` and
convert the dependency declarations.
